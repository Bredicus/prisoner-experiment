Prisoner Experiment Simulator

The embedded video explains what this is simulating.<br>
The following variables are set as maximums by default but you can modify them in the console if you wish to but note these operations are running on your device and are blocking.<br>
<br>
  let maxCols = 25;<br>
  let maxRuns = 100;<br>
  let maxParticipants = 500;<br>
<br>
The maxRuns variable is dynamic. If the number of participants is set to 100 or lower, the maximum runs is set to 1000.<br>
